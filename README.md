# sidebase

> With **sidebase** every new project feel like a fun side-project while scaling to production.

sidebase is a modern, best-practice, batteries-included fullstack-app starter based on Nuxt 3 and TypeScript.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sidestream-tech/sidebase my-app
    ```
2. Go into the `app/` directory
    ```sh
    cd my-app/app
    ```
3. Install the dependencies
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```
4. Start developing (with database, backend, API, ... running) at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Have fun, as [Atinux, CEO of Nuxt](https://github.com/Atinux) said:

## Features

The key features are:
- üéí **Fullstack**: Develop frontend and backend in a single TypeScript code base
    - Fullstack [`Vue 3`](https://vuejs.org/) + [`Nuxt 3 RC.9`](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/),
    - Data base models, migrations, queries and easy DB-switching via [`TypeORM`](https://typeorm.io/),
    - Frontend- and Backend data-transformation via [`nuxt-sidebase-parse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sidestream-tech/nuxt-sidebase-parse) and [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod),
    - In-memory development SQL-database via [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
    - Linting via [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/),
    - Test management, Test UI, component snapshotting via [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/),
    - Component tests via [`test-library/vue`](https://testing-library.com/),
    - API tests via [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest),
    - Code coverage via [`c8`](https://github.com/bcoe/c8),
    - Component stories via [`histoire`](https://histoire.dev/),
    - CSS utiltities via [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/),
    - CSS components via [`Ant Design Vue`](https://antdv.com/components/overview),
    - Type checking in script and template via [`Volar / vue-tsc`](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar)
- üèéÔ∏è **Fast to code**: Database, example tests, example components and example pages are all there for you to fill out
- üêõ **Fewer bugs**: Strong data-validation using `zod` to validate all transferred data, fully typed API-routes, strict DB models via `TypeORM`
- üòä **Easy to use**: Designed to follow best practices and to be ready-to-go for development, without additional dev-dependencies like `docker` that make it hard to get started
- üöÄ **Ready for launch**: Github Actions CI, Dockerfile, easy switch to most popular SQL-databases are all there, out of the box ([get in touch if you're missing something](https://github.com/sidestream-tech/sidebase/issues/new/choose))

To facilitate this `sidebase` bootstraps a nuxt 3 project that permits developing a backend and a frontend using just Nuxt 3 with overarching TypeScript support. We want to show the world how enjoyable end-to-end typescript programming can be, displacing the myth that JS/TS-backends are no good. This starter solves a lot fo the "real-world" problems that occur after you start using Nuxt or any other framework: How to write backend tests? How to write component tests? How to calculate test coverage? How to integrate a database? How to build a docker image? ...?

If you have any problems with this project (e.g., setting it up on your PC) [open an issue](https://github.com/sidestream-tech/sidebase/issues/new/choose) and we'll figure it out together with you üéâ

## Commands and Further Documentation

You can also:
- `npm run story` for isolated component development using `histoire` (see [`ShowCase.story.vue`](./app/components/example/ShowCase.story.vue) as example)
- `npm run test` for testing (see [`ShowCase.test.ts`](./app/components/example/ShowCase.test.ts) as example)
    - `npm run test -- -u` to update the component snapshots
    - `npm run test -- -t "test describe text"` to run a specific test
    - `npm run test:ui` to start the [vitest UI](https://vitest.dev/guide/ui.html)
- `npm run lint` for linting using `eslint`
- `npm run build` for bundling using `vite`

Have a look at the more detailed [readme of the fullstack app](./app/README.md) to see a broader, more in-depth explanation and documentation of commands.

### Highlights

1. Use the [`nuxt-sidestream-parse` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sidestream-tech/nuxt-sidebase-parse) to make the frontend talk to the backend like a charm:
    - Define an endpoint that returns complex data (e.g.: date-objects):
        ```ts
        // file: ~/server/api/test.get.ts
        import { createError, defineEventHandler } from 'h3'
        import { z } from '@sidestream-tech/nuxt-sidebase-parse'

        export const responseSchema = z.object({
            fixedString: z.literal('healthy'),
            aDate: z.date(),
        })

        export type ResponseSchema = z.infer<typeof responseSchema>

        export default defineEventHandler((): ResponseSchema => {
            return {
                fixedString: 'healthy',
                aDate: new Date()
            }
        })
        ```
    - Call it from the frontend:
        ```ts
        import { makeParser } from '@sidestream-tech/nuxt-sidebase-parse'
        import { responseSchema } from '~/server/api/test.get'

        // Hover over data, you will see it strongly types, even the date-strings have been deserialized into `Date` objects (:
        const transform = makeParser(responseSchema)
        const { data } = await useFetch('/api/healthz', { transform })
        ```
    - That's it! `data` will be fully typed AND all data inside will be de-serialized, so `aDate` will be a `Date`-object, and not a string, that you first need to deserialize!
    - Checkout [the example endpoint for a more complex example](./app/server/api/healthz.get.ts)
